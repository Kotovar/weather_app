# Weather App

Weather App is an application that allows you to find out the current weather and three-day forecast in any city in the world. You can enter the city name in the search field at the top of the page and get information about temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, precipitation, air quality, sunrise and sunset. If you enter an incorrect city name, the application will notify you of the error.

## How it works

To create this application I used the following technologies:
